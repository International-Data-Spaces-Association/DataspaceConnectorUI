            The information needed to add a new IDS resource is separated into three types:
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Meta data: </b>General information about the resource data.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Policy: </b>Information about how often or how long the resource data can be used.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Representation: </b>How is the data accessed?
            <br>

        <v-card-text>
            Overview of all currently defined backend connections.<br>
            A backend connection defines how the data of an IDS resource can be accessed. For example a database URL
            with credentials.

            Creation of a route. Nodes of the types "Backend", "App" and "IDS Endpoint" can be created and connected by
            edges. For each edge, the inputs and outputs to be connected can be selected by double-clicking. The

            There are two ways to request an IDS resource from another Connector:
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Connector: </b>Enter a connector URL directly (use "/api/ids/data" endpoint) and get a list of all
            resources of this connector, which
            can be requested.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Broker: </b>Enter a broker URL and search term. The broker then returns a list of resources from various
            connectors, which can be requested.
